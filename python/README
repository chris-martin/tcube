It takes some effort to get this python code to run on GTmob.

The python version installed on the machine is absurdly outdated, so we compiled
Python 2.7.2. I couldn't figure out how to compile it with SSL support against
the existing SSL installation, so we're also using our own compile of OpenSSL 0.9.8g.

The python library support on the machine is also lacking. We are using local
installations of the following python packages:

  argparse-1.1.2
  BeautifulSoup-3.2.0
  mechanize-0.2.5
